        "desc": "The 574 was built to be a reliable shoe that could do a lot of different things well rather than as a platform for revolutionary technology, or as a premium materials showcase.

As hybrid road/trail design built on a wider last than the previous generation’s narrow racing silhouettes, the 574 offered a uniquely versatile mix of new, different, uncomplicated, rugged, durable, and comfortable that was adopted as a closet staple across the globe. Weigt 323.6 grams (11.4 oz). Material - Suede/mesh upper and Vamp, collar and tongue mesh are 100% recycled polyester."
